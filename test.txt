Ghostbusters

If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood
Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
If there's somethin' weird and it don't look good
Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

If you're seein' things runnin' through your head
Who can you call (Ghostbusters)
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed, oh Who you gonna call
(Ghostbusters)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
If you're all alone, pick up the phone and call (Ghostbusters)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I hear it likes the girls
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
Mmm, if you've had dose of a freaky ghost, baby
You'd better call (Ghostbusters), oh

Let me tell you somethin'
Bustin' makes me feel good

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Don't get caught alone, oh, no (Ghostbusters)
When it comes through your door, unless you just want some more
I think you better call (Ghostbusters), oh

Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
I think you better call (Ghostbusters), ha-ha
Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters), I can't hear you

Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
Louder (Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call (Ghostbusters)
Who can you call (Ghostbusters)
